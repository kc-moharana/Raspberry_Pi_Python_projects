# Set Up a Headless Raspberry Pi

Perform a Raspberry Pi headless setup and use a separate laptop to remotely access your Pi over network.

## Steps to setup remote access: SSH
- Flash the OS on the Memory card using Rapsberry Pi imager
- Now you may see two extra drives:
	+ `/boot` : visible on Windows OS
	+ '/memory': not visible on Windows OS becasue of ext3 formatting
- Need to create an empty file `ssh` on `\boot` to enable SSH accesss
- Need to create `wpa_supplicant.conf` on `/boot`
	+ Raspbian OS, since May 2016, checks the contents of the `\boot` for a file called `wpa_supplicant.conf` 
	+ On first boot this file will be **moved** into `/etc/wpa_supplicant`
	+ Replacing any existing `wpa_supplicant.conf` file that may be there

- THis is heavily dependant on the OS versions
- the new *Raspbian OS with Desktop* requires an initial GUI and display unit to setup the `username`
	+ `pi` is not the root user now!! (Release date: April 4th 2022,System: 64-bit, Kernel version: 5.15)
	+ set wifi passowrds 


## SSHing from wi-fi network
- may use tools like `Advanced_IP_Scanner` to find your `raspberry-pi`'s IP.
- may try the deault host name of `raspberry-pi` to SSH
	+ `ssh kcm@raspberrypi.local`
