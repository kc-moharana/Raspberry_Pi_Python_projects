# Github setup
- When working with GitHub, using SSH keys is a secure and convenient way to authenticate your Git operations without needing to enter your username and password every time.
- SSH (Secure Shell) keys are a pair of cryptographic keys used to authenticate a secure connection between your local machine and a remote server—in this case, GitHub.
- Here is a clear, detailed, beginner-friendly guide to set up SSH keys for GitHub on your Raspberry Pi:

## Step1: Check if you have any ssh keys

```sh
ls -al ~/.ssh

```
- If you see files like `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` (or `id_ed25519`, `id_ed25519.pub`), you already have keys.
If not, proceed to generate them.

## Step2: Generate a new SSH key pair
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
# or
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "user_email@example.com"

# use the email one used in github acc
```
- Replace `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email.
- you’ll be asked to enter a file name and passphrase. 
	+ File name can be :  `/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa_github`
	+ `Passphrase` is optional, but adding a passphrase adds an extra layer of security. Empty means no passphrase. 

## Step3: Add your SSH key to the SSH agent
```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github

```

## Step4: Copy your public key to the clipboard
```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github.pub
```
- Copy the entire output, starting with `ssh-ed25519`/`ssh-rsa` and ending with your email.

## Step 5: Add your SSH key to your GitHub account
1. Go to [GitHub SSH keys settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) .
2. Click “New SSH key”.
3. Set a title (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
4. Paste your copied public key into the “Key” field.
5. Click “Add SSH key.”

## Step 6: Test your SSH connection to GitHub
```sh
ssh -T git@github.com

```
- The first time, it may prompt:

```rust
The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP_ADDRESS)' can't be established.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```
- Enter `yes`.

## Step7: Clone repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git

```
## Step8: Optional Permission change
```sh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

```

# Managing multiple SSH keys for multiple hostnames 
- This can be easily done by creating a `~/.ssh/config` file.

```sh
nano ~/.ssh/config

```

## Basic structure for multiple SSH keys
```sh
# Personal GitHub account
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_personal

# Work GitHub account
Host github-work
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_work

# Bitbucket
Host bitbucket.org
    HostName bitbucket.org
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_bitbucket

# Custom server
Host myserver
    HostName myserver.example.com
    User pi
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_myserver


```
- set permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config`
- Check which key is being used
	+ `ssh -T -v git@github-work`
	+ `ssh -T -v git@github.com`

- You are ready to push. Good luck!!
