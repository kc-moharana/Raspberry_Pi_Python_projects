# Light Emiting Diodes (LED)
- Longer leg: +ve anode end

# Buzzers
- piezoelectric buzzers: 
    + active buzzers: they only need a DC voltage to produce sound
    + passive buzzers: Passive buzzers need an AC voltage to produce sound

# Motors
## L298N Motor Driver (H-Bridge) with Raspberry Pi and control a DC Motor
- Connect the ENA pin of L298N to Physical Pin 22 (GPIO25) of Raspberry Pi.
- connect the IN1 and IN2 of L298N Module to Physical Pins 16 and 18 (GPIO23 and GPIO24).
