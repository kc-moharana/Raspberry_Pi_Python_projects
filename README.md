# Raspberry_Pi_Python_projects
Raspberry Pi projects using pyhon libraries. 

To explore more practical application of computer pragramming I wanted to learn how to operate various harwares using customized scripts (python/C/Perl/PHP). I am trying to
learn/develop novel/DIY projects that involved Internet/Intranet network, hardware (LED/Buzzer/electronics), programming.

## Category of projects
 - web-Servers
 - Electronic circuits
 - automating manual operations
 - Bioinformatics

## Raspberry Pi model used:
 - Raspberry Pi-3B
 -



## Future goals
- To deploy the scripts as embedded independent items
- Implement Artificial intelligence/ Machine learning algorithms
- IoT projects interfacing Alexa/Google assistant commands
- Projects helpful in Agriculture and other plant focused problems
