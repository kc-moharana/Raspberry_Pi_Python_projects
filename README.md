# Raspberry_Pi_Python_projects
Raspberry Pi projects using pyhon libraries. 

To explore more practical application of computer pragramming I wanted to learn how to operate/interact various harwares using customized scripts (python/C/Perl/PHP). I am trying to
learn/develop novel/DIY projects that involves Internet/Intranet network, hardwares (LED/Buzzer/electronic sensor modules) and programming.

## Scope of projects
 - PWA apps with Web-Servers
 - Logic operated Electronic circuits 
 - Automating manual Operations
 - Bioinformatics

## Raspberry Pi model used:
 - Raspberry Pi 3B rev 1.2
	+ OS Kernel: Linux raspberrypi 5.15.32-v8+
	+ OS kernel: Linux raspberrypi 6.6.47+rpt-rpi-v8 
 - Remote access set-up see here.


## Future goals
- To deploy the scripts as embedded independent items
- Implement Artificial intelligence/ Machine learning algorithms
- IoT projects interfacing Alexa/Google assistant commands
- Projects helpful in Agriculture and other plant focused problems
